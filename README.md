# software-design-docs [In Progress...]

**Generic templates** for the different types of Software Design Documents.

The structure for each of the template documents will most definitely vary due to;
* differences in requirements for different software projects.
* varying design practices across companies & industries.

## Types of software design documents:

* [Concept Paper]("./concept_paper.md")
  
  * Briefly introduces and describes a problem, proposes a solution(s) and provides justification for the software solution(s). The concept paper is a deliverable at the end of an ideation (idea conceptualization) phase and is typically 1-2 pages long.
  * This helps provide some context for team leads/managers to escalate further up the hierarchy for approval & resource allocation if they see a value proposition (to the company) in what's described in the concept paper.
    
* [Software Requirements Specification (SRS)]("./software_requirements_specification.md")
  
* [Software Design Document (SDD)]("./software_design_document.md")
